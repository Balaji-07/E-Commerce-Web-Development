        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The technical society we live in is in a constant state of advancement and we are continually 
            introduced to new innovative ways of mediating information through. Today, plenty of media 
            channels exist, for organizations to use when they strive to reach larger groups of people, but 
            to achieve web site success; researchers have stated that considerations of user preferences 
            implemented in web design are crucial. This makes understanding and addressing which
            characteristics will be valued from the moment a user enters a site something that is
            considered helpful to the web designer in order to maintain user traffic and create an interest. 
            In other words, something to catch the userâ€™s attention to create a good first impression is
            necessary.<br><br>
            The constant state of advancement of technology prevailing today has resulted in even more 
            complex websites and a countless number of design principles to apply when designing for
            the web. In spite of this, usability and visual appeal have remained central in prior research. 
            To test these theories, a study was conducted by using a qualitative method in form of an 
            experiment consisting of eye tracking and an open-ended questionnaire. To perform the eye 
            tracking the researchers created two mock-ups representing the main page of two different 
            websites. Each mock-up was developed with considerations towards two different design
            approaches, one striving to achieve visual appeal and the other towards usability, to
            determine which one the participants preferred.</p>
